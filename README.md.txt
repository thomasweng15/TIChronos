Modifications on the ez430 Chronos Watch by Texas Instruments. 

I worked on this a bit before making a repo for it for version control 
and data backup, so some features are still being worked on and there are
a lot of loose ends in the initial commit! 

In addition to the features that come with the watch, I have included the 
following:
-Secondary clock showing another time zone
-Egg Timer
-Scrolling Message

I am in the middle of modifying the world clock, so the code is not complete.
Once I finish implementing that feature, I will update code style before 
continuing to work on other features.
