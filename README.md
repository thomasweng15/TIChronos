Modifications to the ez430 Chronos Watch by Texas Instruments. 

I worked on this a bit before making a repo for it for version control 
and data backup, so some features are still being worked on and there are
a lot of loose ends in the initial commit! 

In addition to the features that come with the watch, I have included the 
following:
* Secondary clock showing another time zone
* Egg Timer
* Scrolling Message

Next Steps
----------
1. Finish world clock feature
